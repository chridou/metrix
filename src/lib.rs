//! Metrics for monitoring applications and alerting.
//!
//! ## Goal
//!
//! Applications/services can have a lot of metrics and one of the greatest
//! challenges is organizing them. This is what `metrix` tries to help with.
//!
//! **Metrix** does not aim for providing exact numbers and aims for
//! applications monitoring only.
//!
//! This crate is in a very **early** stage and the API might still change.
//! There may be backends provided for monitoring solutions in the future
//! but currently only a snapshot that can be
//! serialized to JSON is provided.
//!
//! ## How does it work
//!
//! **Metrix** is based on observations collected while running your
//! application. These observations will then be sent to a backend where
//! the actual metrics(counters etc.) are updated. For the metrics configured
//! a snapshot can be queried.
//!
//! The primary focus of **metrix** is to organize these metrics. There are
//! several building blocks available. Most of them can have a name that will
//! then be part of a path within a snapshot.
//!
//! ### Labels
//!
//! Labels link observations to panels. Labels can be of any type that
//! implements `Clone + Eq + Send + 'static`. An `enum` is a good choice for a
//! label.
//!
//! ### Observations
//!
//! An abservation is made somewhere within your application. When an
//! observation is sent to the backend it must have a label attached. This label
//! is then matched against the label of a panel to determine whether an
//! observation is handled for updating or not.
//!
//! ### Instruments
//!
//! Instruments are gauges, meters, etc. An instrument gets updated by an
//! observation where an update is meaningful. Instruments are grouped by
//! `Panel`s.
//!
//! You can find instruments in the module `instruments`.
//!
//! ### Panels
//!
//! A `Panel` groups instruments under same same label. So each instrument
//! within a panel will be updated by observations that have the same label as
//! the panel.
//!
//! Lets say you defined a label `OutgoingRequests`. If you are interested
//! in the request rate and the latencies. You would then create a panel with a
//! label `OutgoingRequests` and add a histogram and a meter.
//!
//! ### Cockpit
//!
//! A cockpit aggregates multiple `Panel`s. A cockpit can be used to monitor
//! different tasks/parts of a component or worklflow. A cockpit
//! is bound to a label type.
//!
//! An example can be that you have service component that calls an external
//! HTTP client. You could be interested in successful calls and failed calls
//! individually. So for both cases you would create a value for your label
//! and then add two panels to the cockpit.
//!
//! Cockpits are in the module `cockpit`.
//!
//! ### Processors
//!
//! The most important processor is the `TelemetryProcessor`. It has
//! a label type as a type parameter and consist of a `TelemetryTransmitter`
//! that sends observations to the backend(used within your app)
//! and the actual `TelemetryProcessor` that forms the backend and
//! processes observations. The `TelemetryProcessor`
//! can **own** several cockpits for a label type.
//!
//! There is also a `ProcessorMount` that is label agnostic and can group
//! several processors. It can also have a name that will be included in the
//! snapshot.
//!
//! The processors can be found the module `processor`.
//!
//! ### Driver
//!
//! The driver **owns** processors and asks the **owned** processors
//! to process their messages. You need to add your processors to
//! a driver to start the machinery. A driver is also a processor
//! which means it can have a name and it can also be part of another
//! hierarchy.
//!
//! Each driver has its own thread for polling its processors
//! so even when attached to another
//! hierarchy all processors registered with the driver will only
//! be driven by that driver.
//!
//! ## Recent changes:
//!
//! * 0.9.2
//!     * measure number of instrumets updated per second
//! * 0.9.1
//!     * `TelemetryDriver` now supports a processing strategy
//! * 0.9.0
//!     * `TelemetryDriver` has a builder
//!     * `TelemetryDriver` is immutable
//!     * Snapshots are calculated in the background thread
//!     * Snapshots can be queried with as a `Future`
//! * 0.8.3
//!     * Use crossbeam channels
//! * 0.8.1
//!     * Fixed bug always reporting all meter rate if 1 munite was enabled
//! * 0.8.0
//!     * Meters only have 1 minute rate enabled by default
//!     * Histograms can track inactivity and reset themselves
//!     * Breaking changes: Moved some traits into other packages
